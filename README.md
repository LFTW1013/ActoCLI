ActoCLI is a CLI (Command line interface) aka Terminal for Windows. I was going to try to upload a packaged version, but it was over the size limit. So instead you are just going to have to use the source files.
ActoCLI is built off of Electron and Node, so you can use DevTools in the "View" menu.

COMMANDS:

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
This installation has not been throughoutly tested, so it may not work. I am working on a way for a simpler install if this does not work.
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/

2. Download the LTS version 

3. Install it and make sure to check the box “Add to PATH”

4. Open a new terminal with Win+R and then "cmd" and verify:

       node -v

       npm -v

You should see version numbers.

5. Run:

       cd (YOUR PATH FOR ACTOCLI GOES HERE)

6. Run:

       npm install
-------------------------

and then:

    npm start
